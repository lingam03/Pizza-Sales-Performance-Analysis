# Pizza-Sales-Performance
In our pizza sales analysis project, we aimed to uncover key insights into revenue patterns, customer preferences, and regional performance to drive better business decisions and strategies. Using MySQL for data extraction and cleaning, we ensured data accuracy and consistency from various sources. With Power BI, we created dynamic and interactive dashboards to visualize sales performance, top-selling pizzas, and high-demand regions.

Tasks Completed:

Data Extraction and Cleaning: We utilized MySQL to extract raw sales data from multiple databases and perform data cleaning operations to eliminate discrepancies and ensure data integrity.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Conducted comprehensive exploratory data analysis to identify significant revenue trends and customer preferences.

Dashboard Creation: Designed and developed interactive Power BI dashboards to present sales performance metrics, visualize top-selling pizzas, and highlight high-demand regions.

Insight Generation: Applied advanced DAX functions in Power BI to calculate accurate metrics and generate actionable insights.

Challenges Faced:

Data Quality Issues: One of the primary challenges was dealing with data quality issues, such as missing values and inconsistencies, which required thorough cleaning and validation.

Complex Data Structures: Managing and integrating complex data structures from different sources posed a significant challenge, necessitating efficient database management and querying techniques.

Real-time Analysis: Ensuring real-time data analysis and updating dashboards to reflect the most current data was another key challenge that required the optimization of data refresh processes.

Tools Used:

MySQL: For data extraction, cleaning, and integration.

Power BI: For creating dynamic dashboards, data visualization, and applying DAX functions.

The insights derived from this analysis provided valuable recommendations for optimizing marketing strategies, enhancing customer engagement, and ultimately driving increased sales and customer satisfaction.
